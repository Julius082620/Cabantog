<h1>Mission</h1>
   <p>It all starts with curating a product lineup that includes the best vape products available anywhere in the world. We truly scour the globe for the best stuff and bring it into our shops and on to our website. Having the best products doesn't mean much if they can't be had at an affordable price, so we ensure that we pass the best deal possible on to our customers. 
    Our customer service starts with our people. The primary goal of every team member at Good Guy Vapes is customer satisfaction. We pride ourselves on making sure every customer is happy with their experience at Good Guy Vapes. 
    What started as a small vape shop modeled on the kind of place we ourselves would want to shop and hang out has grown into multiple locations across seven states. Our vision is to continue to bring our model of high quality, low prices and customer satisfaction wherever the vape community will have us! </p>

<h1>Vision</h1>
       <p> The full extent of health problems caused by combining e-cigarettes with other tobacco products isn't yet clear. But dual users are more likely to report eye problems including dryness, redness, pain, blurry vision, light sensitivity, and headaches, according to a study of more than 4,000 adolescents and young adults.</p>
